A project to model/solve the Meiji Chocolate takenoko and kinoko slider puzzles.

These puzzles are like the classic 15 sliding tile puzzles, but with a twist:
The tiles include parts which overlap the edges, blocking some moves.

This implementation of a slider puzzle will attempt to model these puzzles and
expand on those to achieve a solver which will be able to help manipulate the
puzzle between given goal and result states.
